The erlang and OTP are lacking explicite matrix support. But sometime we want to keep some information in this form.
Here is presentation of possible implementations of matrixes. 

Every implementation contains rows_sum/1, cols_sum/1, get_value/3 and set_value/4 functions.

To run all unit tests use:
> make test
